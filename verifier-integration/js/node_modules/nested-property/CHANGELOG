### 1.0.0 - 22 JUNE 2019

* Breaking Change: When calling `set()` with an integer in the path and `nested-property` creates an object at the location, the object is now an array instead of an object. Hopefully, no user of the `nested-property` package should have been expecting to see an object instead of an array, but this constitutes a breaking changes, hence the major update in the semver.

### 0.0.4 - 15 JAN 2015
